Welcome to the Lightning Pose documentation
===========================================

Lightning Pose is an open source deep learning package for animal pose estimation
(`Biderman, Whiteway et al. 2024, Nature Methods <https://rdcu.be/dLP3z>`_).
The framework is based on Pytorch Lightning and supports accelerated training on unlabeled videos
using NVIDIA DALI. Models can be evaluated with TensorBoard, FiftyOne, and Streamlit.

If you would like to try out Lightning Pose, we provide a
`Google Colab notebook <https://colab.research.google.com/github/paninski-lab/lightning-pose/blob/main/scripts/litpose_training_demo.ipynb>`_
that steps through the process of training and evaluating a model on an example dataset
- no data labeling or software installation required!

We also provide a
`browser-based GUI <https://github.com/Lightning-Universe/Pose-app>`_
that supports the full life cycle of a pose estimation project, from data annotation to model
training to diagnostic visualizations.
